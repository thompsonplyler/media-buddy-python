What You Can Do

Kontext excels at:

    Style Transfer: Convert photos to different art styles (watercolor, oil painting, sketches)
    Object/Clothing Changes: Modify hairstyles, add accessories, change colors
    Text Editing: Replace text in signs, posters, and labels
    Background Swapping: Change environments while preserving subjects
    Character Consistency: Maintain identity across multiple edits

Prompting Best Practices
Be Specific

    Use clear, detailed language with exact colors and descriptions
    Avoid vague terms like “make it better”
    Name subjects directly: “the woman with short black hair” vs. “she”

Preserve Intentionally

    Specify what should stay the same: “while keeping the same facial features”
    Use “maintain the original composition” to preserve layout
    For background changes: “Change the background to a beach while keeping the person in the exact same position”

Text Editing Tips

    Use quotation marks: “replace ‘old text’ with ‘new text’”
    Stick to readable fonts
    Match text length when possible to preserve layout

Style Transfer

    Be specific about artistic styles: “impressionist painting” not “artistic”
    Reference known movements: “Renaissance” or “1960s pop art”
    Describe key traits: “visible brushstrokes, thick paint texture”

Complex Edits

    Break into smaller steps for better results
    Start simple and iterate
    Use descriptive action verbs instead of “transform” for more control

Tips Summary

    Be specific with colors, styles, and descriptions
    Start simple and iterate on successful edits
    Preserve intentionally by stating what to keep unchanged
    Use quotation marks for exact text replacements
    Control composition by specifying camera angles and framing
    Choose verbs carefully - “change” vs “transform” gives different results
