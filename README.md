# Media Buddy

**A Flask-based AI pipeline that transforms news articles into personalized, voiced content using sophisticated prompt engineering and vector embeddings.**

Media Buddy fetches full news articles (not just snippets), processes them through multiple AI stages, and outputs content that authentically matches your personal writing style.

## üéØ Project Purpose

Media Buddy solves the **"AI voice adoption problem"** that most systems struggle with. Instead of generic AI-generated content, it:

- **Learns Your Voice**: Uses 70KB+ of personal writing samples to understand your unique style, tone, and perspective
- **Separates Style from Content**: Sophisticated prompt engineering that captures _how_ you write, not _what_ you write about
- **Fetches Full Articles**: Uses Google News + Playwright scraping to get complete article content (4,000-8,900 characters vs 214-character snippets)
- **Generates Semantic Embeddings**: Creates 384-dimensional vectors for intelligent content similarity and search
- **Builds Visual Timelines**: Converts text into structured visual scene descriptions for multimedia projects

The core innovation is a 7-step pipeline that transforms raw news into personalized, voiced content while maintaining semantic understanding through vector embeddings.

## üîß System Requirements

### Required Software (Must Install First)

1. **Python 3.10+** (Tested on Python 3.10.11)
2. **PostgreSQL 14+** with **pgvector extension**
   - pgvector must be compiled and installed on your system
   - See [pgvector installation guide](https://github.com/pgvector/pgvector#installation)
3. **Git** (for cloning the repository)
4. **Playwright** (for web scraping full articles)
   - Automatically installs browser binaries on first use

### Hardware Recommendations

- **GPU**: CUDA-compatible GPU recommended for faster embedding generation (automatically falls back to CPU)
- **RAM**: 8GB+ recommended (AI models and vector processing are memory-intensive)
- **Storage**: 2GB+ for models and generated content
- **Network**: Stable internet connection for news scraping (some sites implement bot detection)

### Development Environment

**IMPORTANT**: This project is developed and tested on **Windows PowerShell**. All command examples use PowerShell syntax (`$env:VARIABLE = "value"`).

## üöÄ Quick Start

### 1. Clone and Setup

```powershell
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd media-buddy

# Create and activate virtual environment (Windows PowerShell)
python -m venv venv
.\venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Install Playwright browsers (required for news scraping)
playwright install
```

### 2. Critical: Setup RAG Component (Writing Style Samples)

**‚ö†Ô∏è Important**: The RAG folder (`private/writing_style_samples/`) is excluded from git for privacy. You must create it manually.

**What to include**:

- Personal essays, blog posts, social media content
- Political opinions, book reviews, personal reflections
- Aim for 50KB+ total content for best voice adoption results
- Save as `.md` files with descriptive names

### 3. Environment Configuration

Create a `.env` file in the project root:

```bash
# Database Configuration
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://username:password@localhost:5432/media_buddy

# API Keys
GEMINI_API_KEY=your_gemini_api_key_here
NEWS_API_KEY=your_news_api_key_here

# Article Service Configuration
ARTICLE_SERVICE=googlenews  # Options: 'newsapi' or 'googlenews'

# Optional: Hugging Face for additional models
HF_API_KEY=your_huggingface_key_here
```

### 4. Database Setup

```powershell
# Initialize database and create tables
flask init-db

# This creates all tables including vector column for embeddings
# Requires pgvector extension to be installed in PostgreSQL
```

## üìñ Usage

### Collaborative Writing Workflow (NEW!)

Media Buddy now features a sophisticated collaborative writing workflow that combines human perspective with AI enhancement:

```powershell
# 1. Discover and create articles with full content (not snippets!)
flask discover-story "artificial intelligence breakthroughs"
flask create-article --query "artificial intelligence breakthroughs" --auto

# 2. Initialize workflow state management
flask workflow-init --article-id 1

# 3. Add your unique perspective to the story
flask contribute-take --article-id 1

# 4. AI enhances your contribution while preserving your voice
flask enhance-writing --article-id 1 --length 200

# 5. Generate visual timeline from enhanced content
flask generate-enhanced-timeline --article-id 1

# 6. Create images and assemble final assets
flask process-visuals --article-id 1 --theme retro_anime_80s
flask assemble-final --article-id 1
```

**Key Benefits:**

- **Human-AI Collaboration**: Your unique perspective + AI enhancement
- **Full Content**: 4,000-8,900 character articles via Archive.is fallback
- **Workflow State Management**: Persistent state across CLI commands
- **Modular Design**: Each phase can be run independently

### üöÄ Streamlined Turnkey Workflow (NEWEST!)

For maximum efficiency, use the new 5-command turnkey workflow that takes you from story idea to final video:

```powershell
# 1. Create story from your preliminary text + 3 reliable news articles
flask story-create --story-file "my_story.txt" --news-query "AI breakthroughs" --title "My AI Analysis"

# 2. Generate Thompson's enhanced script with timeline and duration estimates
flask script-generate --article-id 123 --length 200

# 3. Review complete timeline and generate styled images (shows full text + visuals)
flask timeline-approve --article-id 123 --theme retro_anime_80s

# 4. Final video composition (video on TOP, images on BOTTOM)
flask video-compose --article-id 123 --video-file "my_recording.mov"

# 5. Track progress and manage workflows
flask story-status --article-id 123
```

**Key Features:**

- **Complete Visibility**: Step 3 shows the entire timeline with text content and visual descriptions
- **Duration Analysis**: Automatic timing estimates (150 words/minute) for precise video planning
- **Video Layout Control**: Recorded video prominently displayed on top with slideshow images below
- **Story-First Approach**: Your preliminary story drives the narrative, enhanced with relevant news context
- **Turnkey Process**: Each command tells you exactly what to run next

**‚ö†Ô∏è Voice Generation Setup**: Since `private/writing_style_samples/` is gitignored, you must:

1. **Create the directory**: `mkdir -p private/writing_style_samples`
2. **Add your writing samples**: Save personal essays, blog posts, and writing samples as `.md` files
3. **Aim for 50KB+ total content**: More samples = better voice adoption
4. **Include diverse content**: Political opinions, reviews, personal reflections for authentic voice capture

### Archive.is Enhancement (Breakthrough!)

For maximum content quality, use the Archive.is enhancement pipeline:

```powershell
# Automatically enhance snippet articles with full content from Archive.is
flask archive-enhance "breaking news topic" --count 3 --verbose
```

This command discovers articles, identifies snippets, and uses Archive.is/Wayback Machine to retrieve full content, often increasing article length by 20-40x.

### Legacy Pipeline Commands

For traditional automated processing:

```powershell
# Complete automated pipeline (bypasses collaborative workflow)
flask process-story --query "topic" --theme "retro_anime_80s" --length 200

# Individual legacy commands
flask fetch-news "artificial intelligence"
flask process-articles
flask generate-voiced-summary --article-id 1 --length 125
flask generate-timeline --article-id 1
```

### Development and Testing Commands

```powershell
# Test image generation with custom prompts
flask test-image --prompt "A futuristic cityscape at sunset"

# Test Archive.is content extraction
flask test-archive --verbose

# Check workflow status
flask workflow-status --article-id 1
flask workflow-status --list-all

# Video generation (requires FFmpeg)
flask create-video --article-id 1
flask compose-video --input-dir "instance/output/1" --width 1080 --height 1920
```
