## IMMEDIATE PRIORITY: Audio Analysis Integration

### Goal: Complete Audio-Visual Synchronization

**Current State**: We have video composition but need audio analysis to complete the production pipeline.

**Required Implementation**:

1. **Audio Duration Analysis**: Parse recorded video files to extract exact audio length
2. **Timeline Timing**: Synchronize image display duration with audio content
3. **Automatic Pacing**: Dynamic scene timing based on speech analysis
4. **Audio Overlay**: Direct audio integration with image slideshow

**Success Criteria**:

- Generated videos have proper audio-visual synchronization
- Image scenes display for appropriate duration based on audio content
- No audio/video timing mismatches
- Professional production quality output

**Implementation Tasks**:

- [ ] Audio file duration extraction using FFmpeg
- [ ] Timeline timing calculation based on audio length
- [ ] Dynamic scene pacing algorithm
- [ ] Audio overlay integration in video composition
