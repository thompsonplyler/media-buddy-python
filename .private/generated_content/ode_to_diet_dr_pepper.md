[VERSE 1]
The health nuts preach from a smug, kale-scented lectern,
"Just drink water," they whisper, a lesson I've unlearned.
Have you tried it? Tastes like static from a dead-air station,
My tongue evolved for flavor, not this bland hydration.
Then the sugar-cult comes, with their full-syrup creed,
Leaves my teeth in sweaters, a fuzzy, sticky need.
But you, you're different, a crisp and perfect schism,
A can of liquid logic, defying catechism.

[CHORUS]
Oh, Diet Dr. Pepper, my fizzy, dark-roast friend,
A battle-tested solace on which I can depend.
Twenty-three flavors in a zero-calorie spree,
You're not a simple choice; you're a philosophy.
You let me fight the doughnut, the siren call of glaze,
And navigate the madness of my self-destructive days.

[VERSE 2]
That dark cherry-vanilla, a taste they can't replicate,
A chemical miracle I'm happy to fate.
And the aspartame-truthers, with their toxic, whispered fears,
They've been crying wolf on that for twenty-seven years.
Show me the data, the double-blind, peer-reviewed kind,
Not just a crystal-healer's rambling, anxious mind.
Until that day arrives, I'll stick with what I know,
You're better than the sludge, you let my caloric budget grow.

[CHORUS]
Oh, Diet Dr. Pepper, my fizzy, dark-roast friend,
A battle-tested solace on which I can depend.
Twenty-three flavors in a zero-calorie spree,
You're not a simple choice; you're a philosophy.
You let me fight the doughnut, the siren call of glaze,
And navigate the madness of my self-destructive days.

[BRIDGE]
I know it's not "sophisticated," no sommelier's delight,
Just a humble can of chemicals that gets me through the night.
But in this world of posers, of false and easy takes,
You're an honest, crisp rebellion, for goodness gracious sakes.
You ask for nothing from me, no sugar, tax, or toll,
You just fizz and understand the chaos in my soul.

[CHORUS]
Oh, Diet Dr. Pepper, my fizzy, dark-roast friend,
A battle-tested solace on which I can depend.
Twenty-three flavors in a zero-calorie spree,
You're not a simple choice; you're a philosophy.
You let me fight the doughnut, the siren call of glaze,
And navigate the madness of my self-destructive days.
