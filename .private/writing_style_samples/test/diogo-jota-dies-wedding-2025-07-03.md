# Thompson's Response: Diogo Jota dies wedding

Right, so, Diogo Jota dies wedding.  What the actual fuck? Turns out this is some kind of… internet hallucination? Like, it's trending, but there's nothing there. Zero. Zip. Nada. Diogo Jota, the Liverpool footballer, is alive and well, last I checked, banging in goals and presumably attending weddings, not dying at them.

This is the internet being the internet, right?  A rumor starts, gets amplified by algorithms designed to reward engagement, regardless of veracity, and suddenly, boom, Diogo Jota’s ghost is haunting the wedding chapel.  We’ve all seen this before.  Remember Boaty McBoatface?  Harmless fun, right?  Except this time it’s someone’s life, their reputation, their family who has to deal with the fallout of this digital bullshit.

It’s this toxic mix of morbid curiosity and the internet's insatiable appetite for the next viral tidbit. We’re so eager to consume, to share, to be part of the conversation that we forget to check if the conversation is even about anything real. And then, of course, there’s the darker side – those who actively spread disinformation for kicks, for profit, or for some twisted sense of power.

So, yeah, Diogo Jota isn’t dead. But this whole mess?  It’s a symptom of a bigger disease. A reminder that we need to be more critical, more skeptical, more human in how we engage with the digital world.  Otherwise, we’re all just feeding the monster.
