Ohboyohboyohboy! Every day just a little closer to death panels! Remember that? remember when Democrats were going to be holding death panels? Good times. Anyway, they're almost here, it just took Republicans to make them happen. Republican senators pushed through Trump's big beautiful bill, which includes drastic cuts to Medicaid. If this gets back to the house and to Trump's desk, it means real people are going to die so a few billionaires can save money on their taxes. Yo, if you're in charge of messaging for a left or progressive politician and you don't hang every single Republican and or Democratic primary opponent by this, you are just WRONG.
