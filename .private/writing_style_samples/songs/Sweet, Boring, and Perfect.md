[Verse 1]
Framed by the shimmering Times Square lights,
Your everything shocked me, young, new, and right.
Too soon we were naked. you loved when I'd bite.
I wasn't prepared for love at first sight.

[Pre-Chorus]
I wasn't pure when I found you.
My soul was a little contused.
But in the light of you smile
That all reconciled,
In an instant I knew something true.

[Chorus]
From the fun in the chaos where we couldn't resist,
There's new thing in history that always persists.
Though I miss those days when my touch burned your skin
When it felt like our eye contact might be a sin
I love our steady horizon, it's always in sight.
You belong in my arms until our last night.

Here are additional lyrics to continue the narrative of evolving love from thrilling beginnings to deep, everyday intimacy.

**[Verse 2]**
A thousand coffee cups on a thousand mornings,  
I still live for your laughter that comes without warning.  
From Netflix binged to the grocery store,  
I learned a new way that my heart can adore.

**[Pre-Chorus 2]**
Every day's routine is embroidered with you,  
You paint simple scenes in a vibrant hue.  
Every mundane touch fills my battery,  
You're first and you're last; you're all that I see.

**[Bridge]**
We've traded wild nights for soft twilight talks,  
Exchanging secrets on evening walks.  
The thrill of the chase has settled to peace,  
True love is calmness from our fiery release.
