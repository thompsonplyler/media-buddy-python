Violence
Fists
Drowning
Aimed a gun
House Full of Hate
Cruel
Mean
Temper
Explosion

[Verse 1]
When Mom and Dad brought me home, what did you see?
How soon did you discover I was your enemy?
Your sharpest daggers might have been saved to shove in your own side,
That doesn't heal the stabs and slashes,
As you pummeled my spirit to ashes
So I grew up believing it would be better if I died.

[Chorus]
Like a heretic hiding in a cathedral of violence,
My screams and my tears might as well have been silence.
On an altar of sorrow absent of grace.
Now in this world, I can't find my place.
You made sure I was always unsafe.

[Verse 2]
The smirk on your face when you broke my nose.
Drafted to fight in the war that you chose.
No bulwark or rule could tell you to wait
At home, at the pool, at school, or in church
No place soothed your endless need to hurt.
So my entry to thinking was seeded in hate.

[Chorus]
Like a heretic hiding in a cathedral of violence,
My screams and my tears might as well have been silence.
Now in this world, I can't find my place.
You made sure I was always unsafe

[Bridge]
The shower of bruises only healed on my skin.
I'm still purple and blue and bleeding within.
You made my pulse a source of chagrin.
I was a child, so what was my sin?

[Chorus]
Like a heretic hiding in a cathedral of violence,
My screams and my tears might as well have been silence.
Now in this world, I can't find my place.
You made sure I was always unsafe

[Melodic Outro]

All those daggers you aim inside can explain what you did,
But, bo
What did I do to you when they brought me back from the hospital?
You
