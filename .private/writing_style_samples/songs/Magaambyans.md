[VERSE]
We left hurricane rains in Jula.
A trail of blood in our wake.
We're supposed to be students and teachers,
There must be some mistake.

[CHORUS]
Years stand between us and those cursed cavern walls,
We stood fast, watched our enemies fall,
Sometimes at night
No one else can see
But I know, how I know, that eye is watching me.

[VERSE]
Some were thugs and some were deserters
And they followed a fiend wrapped in human flesh.
They preyed on behalf of the god of murder,
They wore silk and wore steel,
They wore the stink of death.

[CHORUS]
Years stand between us and those cursed cavern walls,
We stood fast, watched our enemies fall,
Sometimes at night
No one else can see
But I know, how I know, that eye is watching me.

[VERSE]
Some were thugs and some were deserters
And they followed a fiend wrapped in human flesh.
They preyed on behalf of the god of murder,
They wore silk and wore steel,
They wore the stink of death.

[CHORUS]

[VERSE 3]
We are lore speakers, and we're touched by destiny.
Like our dice only land on twenty.
Wish someone would keep me company,
My spine feels his gaze of ebony.
What could prepare me to earn the enmity of a deity?

[CHORUS]

[VERSE 4]
My servants are secret even to themselves.
I come from a darker version of hell.
I see you lie awake at night.
I love it when you fight.
You've never left my sight.

Above the ground, the rain weeps down
from the Eye of Abendego
Muddy souls have risen up to fight,
Steel to steel against the so-called knights.
But darkness stirs beneath the fight, in a place so far below.

More than thugs and kidnappers
The real danger tried to whisper
Monster with the faces of men
They serve the god of murder.
