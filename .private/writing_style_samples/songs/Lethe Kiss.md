[VERSE]  
Ten minutes from strangers, 7s
I didn't know the danger. 9s
We swam in a pool at the end of the galaxy 12s
You broke all the rules 14s
in your tiny bikini 18s
Your wrapped arms around my neck. 21s
(Someone please hold this woman in check) 25s
You were a tsunami of sex 28s
I could never endure 31s
Envolviste mis muslos alrededor de mi cintura. 37s

That's when you kissed me. 41s
That's when you kissed me. 45s
Why did you kiss me? 49s
(in between moments long enough to fill)

[CHORUS]  
We left that water, but I'm still drowning. 52s
You're nowhere around, but my heart is still pounding. 56s
I should still be swimming, 58s
still be sinning 60s
Beso con colmillos, 62s
Possessed me like a demon 64s
veneno en mi sangre. 66s
Such delicious pain. 69s
But pain is still pain. 74s

[VERSE]  
The night was made by my decision 79s
Put a hit on myself with assassin precision. 83s
We left and undressed 86s
Your mouth got hotter 88s
I tasted your breasts  
My mind still in the water. 91s
Maybe it would be easier  
Si me quedara hasta el sábado 96s
Maybe it would be easier 99s
Ojalá me hubiera ahogado 102s

Why did you kiss me? 104s
Why did you kiss me? 109s

[CHORUS]  
We left that water, but I'm still drowning. 112s
You're nowhere around, but my heart is still pounding. 116s
I should still be swimming, still be sinning 120s
Beso con colmillos, 122s
Possessed me like a demon 124s
veneno en mi sangre. 126s
Such delicious pain. 129s
But pain is still pain. 133s

[BRIDGE]  
We pantomimed love. 136s
Lupine jaws on my neck froze me in place. 142s

But when our lips touched 144s
My mind was erased. 147s
Arrastro el pensamiento de tu beso como un albatros 152s
We should have never kissed. 154s
It was too high a cost. 157s

Pretty bit until 163s

Why did you kiss me? 169s

[CHORUS]  
We left that water, but I'm still drowning. 173s
You're nowhere around, but my heart is still pounding. 176s
I should still be swimming, still be sinning 180s
Beso con colmillos,  
Possessed me like a demon 183s
veneno en mi sangre. 186s
Now you're all that I want. 187s
Please find another to haunt. 192s

[CHORUS]  
We left that water, but I'm still drowning. 196s
You're nowhere around, but my heart is still pounding. 200s
I should still be swimming, still be sinning 203s
Beso con colmillos,  
Possessed me like a demon 207s
veneno en mi sangre. 209s
This poisoned memory taunts. 214s
Such delicious pain. 218s
But pain is still pain. 221s

Why did you kiss me? 224s
Why did you kiss me? 226s
Why did you kiss me? 231s
