(Verse 1)
Built up no floor with your uncareful hands,  
Our soundtrack was thunder, our light was your scowl,
Now my white noise is a permanent howl.

(Pre-Chorus)
Acid debates, your legacy,  
Those fist-sized holes are now a part of me.  
Your words Damascus steel in my Achilles heel,  
Now I get to share in that pain you had to feel.

(Chorus)
Father's maze of thorns with no right turns, Where I sleep every night while I wait for the worms.  
Your erratic will stains the air and the sea,
No minotaur here, just a noose calling me.

(Verse 2)
I was too fragile, and you were too rough,
You made it clear I was never enough.
Now I can sneer at others mistakes
I can cut and bruise and laugh when they break.

**(Pre-Chorus)**  
No thought correct, every dream dismissed,  
You didn't protect, just vanquished my bliss.  
My skull is vacant where it should contain hope,
I look in the mirror and want him to choke.

**(Chorus)**  
Father's maze of thorns with no right turns,
Where I sleep every night while I wait for the worms.  
Your erratic will stains the air and the sea,
No minotaur here, just a noose calling me.

(Bridge, a capella)
Behind closed doors, I retrace my paths,  
I claw for the exit from shadows you cast.  
But the lights an illusion. There is no door.
Of this I am certain, which I know you abhor.

**(Chorus)**  
Father's maze of thorns with no right turns, Where I sleep every night while I wait for the worms.  
Your casually cruel will stains the air and the sea,
No minotaur here, just a noose calling me.

(Outro)
You're an old man now,
and look so am I.
My one real joy
is that
we both will
die.
