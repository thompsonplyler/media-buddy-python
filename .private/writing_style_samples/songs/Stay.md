[VERSE]
If I open the door to the world outside,
She looks for approval. She goes when I decide.
It's called a command,
But I mostly suggest.
My beautiful dog decides what's the best.
She can get too excited,
And she'll ignore what I say.
But I know she understands when I tell her to stay.

[CHORUS]
Stay.
Stay.
Buffy, please stay.
When you rescue a puppy,
You sign up for sadness
That's ten years away,
One day your black fur will be threaded with grey.
There will be a last sunset
You'll go your own way.
If you can delay it one morning,
I beg you to stay.
Stay.
Stay.
Buffy, please stay.

[VERSE]
You're so agile and crazy
When you come back from your walk
At night you're so lazy
You dream bork while we talk.
You know heel, paw, and sit
You can practically speak.
Your tail wags your body
When I'm holding your leash.
You're always ready to have fun and play.
But you also know sit, and of course you know stay.

[CHORUS]
Stay.
Stay.
Buffy, please stay.
When you rescue a puppy,
You sign up for sadness
That's ten years away,
One day your black fur will be threaded with grey.
There will be a last sunset
You'll go your own way.
If you can delay it one morning,
I beg you to stay.
Stay.
Stay.
Buffy, please stay.

[VERSE]
Sometimes I wonder which way I would go,
If you'd never been rescued from Puerto Rico.
I'd think I loved dogs,
Because I'd never have known,
How a little Buffy would redefine home.
I'd be less, I know, that's certain true.
But I wouldn't have to face,
That first night without you.
Buffy, don't go, keep the demons at bay.
Buffy, please listen.
Buffy, please stay.

[CHORUS]
Stay.
Stay.
Buffy, please stay.
When you rescue a puppy,
You sign up for sadness
That's ten years away,
One day your black fur will be threaded with grey.
There will be a last sunset
You'll go your own way.
If you can delay it one morning,
I beg you to stay.
Stay.
Stay.
Buffy, please stay.

[HAUNTING A CAPELLA BRIDGE]
I know it's not how the world works.
That's part of love.
When it's gone, how it hurts.
But it's s kind of impossible that such a dog is alive.
So I'm begging you and God:
Buffy, please don't die.

[HAUNTED, MELODIC, WAIL OF AGONY]
BUFFY, PLEASE DON'T DIE

[CHORUS]
Stay.
Stay.
Buffy, please stay.
When you rescue a puppy,
You sign up for sadness
That's ten years away,
One day your black fur will be threaded with grey.
There will be a last sunset
You'll go your own way.
If you can delay it one morning,
I beg you to stay.
Stay.
Stay.
Buffy, please stay.
