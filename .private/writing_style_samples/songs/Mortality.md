[VERSE 1]
Just last year you were a tornado
The year before that dressed like a crusader
The days stayed long but the years got shorter
Gathered up your worries like a bedridden horder

[PRE-CHORUS]
There's only one promise you have to keep
One night will be the last you sleep
There's one sunset before there won't be another.
No time left to heal with your brother.

[CHORUS]
Dutifully, you sowed your fear
Resented as grew each and every year
But nothing changed
No sign of stopping.
Nothing left but to chop it up
And use it as your coffin

Lives unlived
Made no promises to break
Once around, and then we're gone,
No next life waits
