[VERSE 1]
We met hips first, a little lighter wallet.
It wasn't love but it was good,
No matter what you call it.

Orange light to set the mood as I lay in her bed,
Heard the echoes of my predecessors moaning in my head.

[VERSE 2]
But then we started talking,
Though it's dangerous to feel,
Then we started laughing,
And I felt something real.

I didn't trust my heart.
Money had changed hands.
But she asked if I'd sleep over.
Wished I could cancel all my plans.

[CHORUS 1 OF 3]
Let's see how long we can make this hour last.
While the clock is running ain't no future and no past.
While I stay in your room, there's no such thing as lonely.
ừ thèm thuồng một chút thì sẽ nhớ lâu hơn là à no nê.
No hour lasts forever is what she told me.

[VERSE 3]
I recall the little details.
Like she didn't paint her toes.
The artwork on her back.
And the flatness of her nose.

She offered to massage me,
But it didn't quite seem right.
I had been inside her body.
Now I wanted to hold her tight.

[VERSE 4]
No one in the world would have called it love,
But it sure looked like the beginning.
She asked me to sleep over, and I wanted to stay,
Even if there was no more sinning.
But the last sands of the hourglass joined the pile.
Soon the distance between us would be thousands of miles.

[CHORUS 2 OF 3]
Let's see how long we can make this hour last.
While the clock is running ain't no future and no past.
While I stay in your room, there's no such thing as lonely.
ừ thèm thuồng một chút thì sẽ nhớ lâu hơn là à no nê.
No hour lasts forever is what she told me.

[CHORUS 3 OF 3. KEY CHANGE, ANTHEM]
Let's see how long we can make this hour last.
While the clock is running ain't no future and no past.
While I stay in your room, there's no such thing as lonely.
ừ thèm thuồng một chút thì sẽ nhớ lâu hơn là à no nê.
No hour lasts forever is what she told me.
