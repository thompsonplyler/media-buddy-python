[VERSE 1]
Protagonists of the 20th century.
All the propaganda worked on me. 
If I'd made better than a C in history, 
Maybe I wouldn't have picked up a gun for this country.

If I'd bothered to read more than half a page,
Who knows what I would have done with all my rage.

[CHORUS]
My beloved country taught me 
You can't stand your tallest
unless you're kneeling on a dark body's neck. 
I saw traitors colors flying through the Capitol halls
There's Blood on every dollar.

Oh God, the brown bodies.
Oh God, the red bodies. 
Oh God, all these bodies have died for a myth I swore an oath to protect.

[VERSE 2]
Haven't learned a lesson since Gettysburg or Mỹ Lai.
But trust us if we send your kids off to die.
We only wanna hear freedom ring.
We will lie while we look deep in your eyes.
Don't worry napalm doesn't sting.

[CHORUS]

[BRIDGE]
One day I woke up I realized
It was all just an American dream
Gone like the bullet that stole Dr. King
And honey No dream is as real as the steel of a guillotine.

[CHORUS]

---

I turned my heart to stone
to wear my eagle, globe, and anchor.
Try to crush that part of me
that yearned to be a poet or a painter.

People make sure to thank me
Aiming down an iron sight

If I'd done the homework in history class,

I thanked every man in uniform for their service,
I'd see their camouflage
And I wondered what I could do to earn this.

It turns out I love a rifle kicking in my hands.

All because I didn't study history.

When I grew into my passport, my country played her hand,
Except her cards were on the table before I could understand.

Maybe if I hadn't made a C in history
I wouldn't have joined the Marines.
