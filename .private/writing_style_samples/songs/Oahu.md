The November afternoon is a grey marble sky.
The New York sun has started to hide,
Another chilly autumn day gone too soon,
The cold makes my hands crawl inside my wrists
So I close my eyes , and I zoom zoom zoom,
To that island that I always miss.

All we had to think about was what we want to eat.
Do we try a new shave ice place, or do we repeat?
What kind of coffee starts our morning strong?
Do we drive a little bit, or do we drive a little long?

Take me back to room 604,
Where the beach always asked if we wanted some more
I want to wake up before dawn with you
See everything else gone but you.
Float in the infinity pool
Past the Pacific sunset.
The song of the waves we'll never forget.

On the beach
Under rain

Don't let me check out

Before the Pacific Sunrise
