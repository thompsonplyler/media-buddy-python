[VERSE]
L.A. afternoon light set her hair aflame
I had fallen in love but didn't know her name.
Our eyes met with an electric spark.
Until that moment I had been in the dark.

One thing led to another.
We flew around to be with each other.
We talked about forever,
Turned into one more never,

That was a lifetime ago.

[CHORUS]
Some rhymes don't sting if the wound isn't fresh.
Co-stars recast as irrelevant subtext
No one hungry cares about your heartache.
No one cares about ghosts only you can see.
Strangers all in the mist on the lake
That lets us bear our memories.

[VERSE]
Thumbing through the table of contents
Of all the girls who weren't worth dying for after all.
You can sincerely believe something,
And sincerely be wrong.
Bullets dodged by all parties
My heart's not on guard, he's
Joining us all in this song.

[CHORUS]
Some rhymes don't sting if the wound isn't fresh.
Co-stars recast as irrelevant subtext
No one hungry cares about your heartache.
No one cares about ghosts only you can see.
Strangers all in the mist on the lake
That lets us bear our memories.

[HAUNTING BRIDGE, BEAUTIFUL MELODY]
Sometimes the best we can be.
Is ghost who sends a smile,
If you dig for a memory.
I worry the worst that I am
Is a hot stove in a mind,
Half-remembered caution,
that makes it hard for a better man.

[CHORUS]
Some rhymes don't sting if the wound isn't fresh.
Co-stars recast as irrelevant subtext
No one hungry cares about your heartache.
No one cares about ghosts only you can see.
Strangers all in the mist on the lake
That lets us bear our memories.
