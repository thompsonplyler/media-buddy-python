[PRE-VERSE]
When your cities catch fire,
Because enough is enough,
You made the matches,
When the the leaders you choose,
Scorn the voters they chose,
You made the matches.

[VERSE 1]
You start off ready to believe the worst,
And you carry that grudge like a pirate's purse.
You'd dee-escalate, sure, but there's a gun right there.
You'd better not come from the wrong womb, friend,
better not better not dare.

Looks like you're the villains.

[CHORUS 1]
You're welcome to that monopoly on violence,
We see you guarding your panoply of silence.
You enjoy the trust of the guardians at the gate,
But you allow one another to be instruments of hate.
Are the rare and courageous somewhere in there?
Or are they too smart or too good or just running scared.

I think you're the villains.

[VERSE 2]
Law and Order never bothered to show,
A close-up scene with Philando Cast-ee-yo.
You'll hide in Uvald-ee
But still you'll get salty
Because when you murder a someone in custody,
We all want to know.

Dirty Harry and Bad Boys, they never took shit.
And that's why her pit bull has a bullet in it.
You heard a show say acorns could put down a hurtin,
So when you heard one land, lights, camera curtains.

You think you're the ones who walk off with the girl?
Nah, you're the villains.

[CHORUS 2]
You're welcome to that monopoly on violence,
We see you guarding your panoply of silence.
You enjoy the trust of the guardians at the gate,
But you allow one another to be instruments of hate.
Are the rare and courageous somewhere in there?
Or are they too smart or too good or just running scared.

You're the villains.

[VERSE 3]
If you don't serve or protect, then why are you here?
Why does a girl in your backseat have so much to fear?
How can I forfeit my civil assets to you,
When for 8 43 we all saw George Floyd turn blue?

There are monsters out there who are evil and real.
They touch our children, and they think we're a meal.
You're supposed to be out there and ready to stop them.
But his mom was the wrong womb, BOOM you're part of the problem.

Mirror says you're the villain.

[CHORUS 3]
You're welcome to that monopoly on violence,
We see you guarding your panoply of silence.
You enjoy the trust of the guardians at the gate,
But you allow one another to be instruments of hate.
Are the rare and courageous somewhere in there?
Or are they too smart or too good or just running scared.

You don't have to be the villains.
