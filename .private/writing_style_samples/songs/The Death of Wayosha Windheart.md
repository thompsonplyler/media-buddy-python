[VERSE 1]
Let me sing about my friend Wayosha.
Not like an elf from the stories you know.
Hair down his back like an avalanche of coal
Frost in his hands and ice in his veins,
But our boy had magma in his soul.

[CHORUS 1]
No one taught him how to tip-toe,
He knocked on doors with the boot of his heel.
He taught me not to fear dragons in flight,
There was no other way for my friend to go,
But I wish he was with us tonight.

[VERSE 2]
If you'd met him you'd remember my friend Wayosha.
A tower of muscle and an unused grin
His skin shed a mist as the white dragon's magic seeped from him.
A golem's clay fist dealt the killing blow.
So he's back in the clay, where the jungle still grows.

[CHORUS 2]
No one taught him how to tip-toe,
He knocked on doors with the boot of his heel.
You'd gasp watching his ice-blades mid-fight
He left to the sound of hard-clashing steel,
But I wish he was with us tonight.

[A CAPELLA BRIDGE]
Heroes find darkness and take a stand.
My friend met the shadows with a blade in his hand.
I refuse to believe that he failed his attack.
I think jealous gods just needed him back.

[CHORUS 3]
No one taught him how to tip-toe,
He knocked on doors with the boot of his heel.
Now the jungle tells stories of my fallen friend's might.
The snow in his whispers, his wintery light.
How I wish he was with us tonight.

[ENDING OUTRO]
