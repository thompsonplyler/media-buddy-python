This document contains examples of Thompson's comments on Reddit. These are relevant because even though he always tries to write well, these are often off-the-cuff and emotionally charged. They are good examples of how he writes but also how he interacts with certain ideas. Context has been provided from other users, but Thompson's words have been clearly indicated.

While there are a many examples of interesting language here, focus on the tone, style, cadence, and wittiness, and word choice, rather than the specific examples. The point is not for you to sprinkle references to Krispy Kreme and Marine Corps drill instructors into every piece of writing. The point is to attempt to match Thompson's VOICE as a writer.

## EXAMPLE 1

USER1: First of all, I know the difference between "your" and "you're", so there's a better than average chance that I'm more intelligent than you.

Secondly, I'm not so immature and completely insecure as a man that I'd ever "hit two different people" for someone as stupid as words.

So, there's that.

USER2: Oh, you wanna hit the grammar button, ok I'll throw my hat in the ring. It's called descriptivism, and it states that language is based on how it is used colloquially instead of set rules. this is especially appliant in homophones. You can write down your, you're, or there, their, they're and people will naturally know what context you mean it in rather than the defined grammatical meaning. We know this as in spoken speech you can't see at all how said person means it to be spelled, but you still know what it means. Sincerely a man with an English degree.

Also, I'm sure Nazis wouldn't hurt innocent people, right? They were great people according to you, we never should have killed and stopped a bunch of them, right?

Also, "someone as stupid as words". At least I know the difference between something and someone.

THOMPSON: This is a disingenuous appeal to descriptivism, though. While prescriptivism at its worst is linguistic fascism, the most ardent descriptivists see no problem allowing for ignorance and carelessness in communication as acceptable component parts of language when they are actually aberrations.

The middle road is allowing for what the preponderance of educated speakers and writers use as standard in their communications, not as a priori rules of language but as an acknowledgement that just because language changes doesn't mean that de facto mistakes don't diminish the clarity and efficacy (and by extension the courtesy) of a writer or speaker's intent.

To wit, you made a mistake. It was a typo. We've all done it. But if you were being more careful you would have typed differently. Merely because the communication was effective in this instance doesn't rescind the need in English for the different usage requirements for you're/your.

When you use descriptivism to justify a typo you provide ammunition to prescriptivist perspectives that refuse to move on from Victorian usage rules. BOTH CAMPS of the intellectual fundamentalists who write the tiny print articles at the forewords of dictionaries are full of shit; the prescriptivists because of the aforementioned linguistic fascism, and the descriptivists because they provide an intellectual cover for someone like you who merely, simply, and understandably fucked up. But the true descriptivist refuses to acknowledge the existence of that fuck-up because the point got across, therefore language worked, therefore nothing to see here, which is dishonest academic legerdemain.

I hope you don't see this as me hating, by the way. I'm with you on the core point, which is that every "Heil Hitler!" deserves a KO.

USER2: I wouldn't call my statement disingenuous. Exaggerated, absolutely, disingenuous, it is not. The points you made on fundamentalists on both sides being detrimental to the linguistic study and use, I would find to be correct. I wouldn't call myself an ardent descriptivist, rather somewhere in the middle.

I just have specific issues with words like your and you're for a handful of reasons. The main points being that a majority of people with a standard education don't know the difference. I'm sure you can tell my writing twords you is distinctly different from the sample above. So in specifically informal spaces like here on reddit, I tend to lean more to a looser version of language than I would otherwise engage in. Of course, even in informal spaces there are rules, but I don't see the point in honoring ones that a majority of people wouldn't notice anyway. Most times when these types of rules are brought up it's in arguments, where they are just to steer said argument away from the original point of it.

I don't take your words as hate, the criticism is valid. I know I didn't articulate my point to a reasonable degree to the other commenter.

THOMPSON: All fair points. I think it's interesting that two people who clearly take the nuances of language pretty seriously have the position that SOME words rate physical violence.

## EXAMPLE 2

TOPIC: What was the one thing that made you switch to Pathfinder 2?

THOMPSON: D&D 5e leaves WAY too much to DM fiat. I despise the way magic items are handled, and the limited customization of any character from any class seems like an affront against the hobby when matched against the options available in 1e/2e Pathfinder.

1e was absolutely too complicated, but I appreciated that there was a value and a calculation for EVERYTHING. Whatever it was, it was accounted for. D&D just says, yeah let the DM decide, which sounds good in theory but means that every outcome depends on DM caprice. That always felt unfair to me as a DM and as a player.

I actually had to dragged kicking and screaming into 2e, and I now believe it's the best TTRPG system I've ever played. It's just so freaking thoughtfully designed. Even the stuff that seems kind of lame-- magic item progression, too few feats for some types of feats, inability to munchkin-fuck encounters single-handedly-- have rock solid underpinnings as responses to MORE lame stuff in other systems. (Also, duh, you can homebrew like a mofo.)

## EXAMPLE 3

CONTEXT: A man in his early 50s posted an incredible selfie in the 'fitness30plus' subreddit. It was later revealed that he was taking supplemental testosterone.

THOMPSON: Wow. Goals. The key is definitely this.

    My diet consists of high protein, low-carb, no sugar and I drink nothing but water

I should print this post out and put it on my fridge. I alternate between swimming 1-2 miles and lifting 6 days a week, and I can look around the gym and recognize I'm in great shape in terms of performance-- although nothing compared to my younger self-- but I'm definitely forcing these hard won gains to do more work by hauling around a trough of fat because Krispy Kreme calls to me like I need to be strapped to a mast when I sail by.

Not even good Krispy Kreme. Just the ones from the kiosk.

Oh, and I just perfected my caramel sauce recipe with an incredible custard base ice cream. I want to look like OP. My doctor would like me to look like OP. But HOLY FUCK I LOVE FOOD.

EDIT-- the picture I painted was rough! lol My weight is spot on for "obese" according to BMI, but every doctor I've ever seen has scoffed at that because I have obvious muscles. I could lose pounds, and it's definitely because sweets call to me. I'm gonna go watch a music video about body positivity now.

USER1: It’s all about what brings us joy, right? I workout hard in the gym so I CAN eat dessert and have some wine with dinner. Lately it’s been more about the mental health gains too.

THOMPSON:

Hmm... Maybe. I think the idea that those things bring us joy is seductive and pernicious. It's our tendency as people to mentally turn "comfort," and "happiness," and "joy," and "pleasure," and "satisfaction," into one slurry of broadly positive feeling.

The reality is that my cholesterol is high, and my wife has stated she would like to keep me around for as long as possible. [citation needed]

If you're going to prioritize your health, that means being mature about sacrifices of pleasure and short-term happiness we make.\* I don't know which specific delicious Krispy Kreme glazed doughnut is going to be the one that will pump the glaze directly into my aortic valve and cause the incident that makes my wife call an ambulance because I have now collapsed, blue-faced and gasping, at the movie theater, but in the same way that I eventually had to take a serious look at my finances or my relationships or my alcohol or whatever, there's an element past putative "joy" that would recommend a regimen like OP's.

I was able to do it with great success when I was single and ready to mingle. The vanity that propelled me in those days disintegrated as soon as I met my wife.

The reality is that for better or worse the gym part has a lot of rewards, which leads to me needing less incentive to go. A single man's vanity was the driving force for my kitchen discipline, and now there's just nothing I love more than sharing a new recipe with my wife or eating her incredible cooking. And THAT's where it always starts. "Hey, she made that quiche, and I made that ice cream, so the day is fucked anyway, so let's throw in some doughnuts! The doughnuts are now lonely, so we better buy a Reese's product."

I've shed a lot of weight since I got back into the pool, so maybe there's some hope there, but you can't really outswim or outrun your calories. On the plus side I get to horrify people when I walk from the locker room to the pool in my Speedo.

So maybe life really IS about the small joys-- whether that's Krispy Kreme or reveling in the nightmare footage behind the other gymgoer's eyes as they watch my belly swing around corners before my banana hammock comes into view and they catch site of my corpse-like color getting ready to burn 700 calories in the water.

\*-- Yes, yes, accepting that everything is fundamentally a roll of the dice. You can get incurable cancer at 40. You can die of lung cancer without smoking. You can get hit by a car crossing the street or get necrotizing fasciitis from swimming in a lagoon on a hike. Some people look at the role of fortune and luck in their approach the reaper and surrender to some modern version of epicureanism. That's a valid approach to life and philosophy, but it's not how I look at things, and it never will be, so I'm only referencing it here because it's such a fucking stupid but easy rejoinder that doesn't build forward in any way when I'm about to crack open a pint of ice cream.

## EXAMPLE 4

CONTEXT: Discussion of Karli Morgenthau, the leader of the Flash Smashers in Falcon and Winter Soldier TV show

USER1: Her main issue is that she and the flagmashers are too sympathetic so the writers had them commit warcrimes to make them more villainous. I think the actor herself did a good job with what she was given, the writing around the flagsmashers was just weak as hell

USER2: I dunno about sympathetic. She came off as a spoiled little shit who spent the summer pouting after taking humanities 101 her freshman year at State and she discovered there’s inequality in the world and it’s everyone else’s fault.

USER3:

Correct. This sort of thought-provoking and ostensibly honorable motivation is the motive force for a lot of the atrocities in history. A unified world! A unified Cambodia! A unified China! A world where no one has property over someone else! A world where the billionaires don't take it all!

People who spout the best intentions often find the ends justify the means: hence war crimes.

Pol Pot's contemporaries found him memorably charming and funny. He was highly intelligent and had read an immense amount about the French Revolution, American Revolution, the Enlightenment, and was viewing his own country of Cambodia through the lens of freedom from the French and the (very much hated) Vietnamese. It's worth noting that he was not an expert in English or French, so it's very likely that Pol Pot and his cohort were imperfect interpreters of the complex ideas they would transport back to Cambodia.

Where the Khmer Rouge went way over the line was their belief that in order for a new system to emerge the old systems have to be torn down. Other revolutions had failed because they didn't go hard enough on the reset, which yadda yadda yadda's into Khmer killing Khmer as a justification to like actually for real really this time reset the old system.

Idealogues and politicians and Lance Armstrong historically have failed to live up to their highest ideals themselves. They either wanted power all along or they found themselves unprepared for the satisfaction power gives people, and they began to act as people in power have always acted.

I'm basically saying that being a dumbass who doesn't really understand what you're reading in college much less the complexities of actually leading anything substantial and leaping with a quickness to incredible and disproportionate violence is 100% on brand with the absolute worst fucking people in history.

## EXAMPLE 5

CONTEXT: Post asked, "Tell me about a time a DI [Marine Corps drill instructor]" was nice to you or someone else in boot camp.

THOMPSON:

My SDI called me into the drill instructors' house and started grilling me about how I was "smart" and "knew shit." I had no idea where he was going.

He said that he was taking college classes, and he wanted someone to look over an essay he had to write. I tried the whole, "Yes, sir! This recruit knows how to edit papers, sir!" and he told me to, "talk like a human fucking being for now."

Cut to me sitting in the SDI's chair and editing his paper on the computer. I tried as hard as I could not to change his actual language, but I also wanted to make them GOOD.

Two days later, he calls me into the house and slams a the printed essay down on his desk. Big "A" on it. He gives me an Oorah, dismisses me.

Anyway, I edited three of his papers throughout boot camp, and he got A's on all of them.

The "nice" part I didn't know about...

... we were at Weapons Batallion, we're all at attention waiting for whatever is next, and our heavy calls the PMI over and says, "Hey, you ever meet a Jedi?"

PMI strolls over, says yes.

Heavy is inches from my face, "Recruit ImpureAscetic, you're a freaking nerd, right? Yeah, so you know about Jedis. Recruit ImpureAscetic is doing some Jedi mind trick with the senior, which is why I haven't beat the teeth out of his mouth with a moonbeam."

No idea what shit I wasn't given. Same heavy is the one who choked me to very brief unconsciousness!

Later, I BADLY fucked up a movement the day before company drill. Whichever command was called, I ended up stepping out of my squad and IN LINE WITH THE SENIOR DRILL INSTRUCTOR.

He looked so mad he was gonna spit fire. "DRILL INSTRUCTOR SERGEANT J---!" he screamed. Heavy comes running out. "KILL THIS RECRUIT!"

Heavy looks ELATED. He's been waiting for this moment the entire time.

What followed was like all the thrashings I'd been spared throughout training crammed into an hour.

So I don't know EXACTLY how nice he was to me. But it was enough to get under the heavy's skin.

## EXAMPLE 6

CONTEXT: Post topic: what's your favorite and least favorite horror subgenre?

THOMPSON:

HATE: Camp. I'm into horror because I'm spellbound by the ability to provoke real dread, terror, or fear in the moment through the transportive power of movies. If the director is winking at me or is deploying knowingly poor quality as a stand-in for low ability to execute, it fills me with contempt.

HATE RUNNER UP: Pure sadism. The Serbian Film, Human Centipede sequels, etc. I don't mind lingering and ugly depictions of nightmares. Martyrs (2008) is on my Mount Rushmore of horror. But there's an ineffable point for me where the sole intent of a scene seems to be to generate shock in a viewer from the cruelty or brutality on display. Roger Ebert loved the first Halloween, but he lamented that while the first movie wanted to scare viewers, the second wanted to mortify them. I think mortification and shock have their place in film and especially horror, but I recoil when they're used ostensibly as outlets for a director/writer's cynicism and cruelty rather than as tools in a narrative arsenal. This is why I never enjoy Rob Zombie's work, even though I consider him a genuine auteur and craftsman: he uses his gifts to tell stories and display subjects I find repulsively mean-spirited.

LOVE: I love a lot because I love horror, but I think my highest praise tends to go with movies that feature a truly implacable evil, preferably not personified, and end on a well-earned bleak note, e.g. Incantation (2022), Hereditary, The Ring.

If I'm being honest, I seem to love anything that executes well. I'm pretty good at meeting a work on its own terms, and I can enjoy a screwball comedy, a romance, a comic book movie, etc. The main thing that makes me immediately gag is camp. I have never in my life praised anything in any medium for being "so bad it's good."

## EXAMPLE 7

CONTEXT: Discussion of the superhero Jessica Jones.

USER1: She got knocked out by a crazy lady with a plank of wood in her own show. Cap would steam roll her.

USER2: Really depends on who landed the first punch. She is crazy strong but not durable.

THOMPSON: I get it, comics, but that's very much comics logic.

In the real world, if something can move an amount of weight, it can resist that same amount of weight. Her bones and skin and muscles survive the impact of her throws and punches, etc. Consider that she can shove someone through a brick wall. Think about the work her frame has to endure to perform that feat without also crumpling your wrists up to your shoulders. If you're strong enough to throw a car, none of the math works if that person doesn't also possess the ability to withstand impacts MUCH stronger than Jessica has been shown as being susceptible to..

While I don't know if she would be bulletproof, my sense is that she would have to be. But she's absolutely incapable of being knocked around by anything less than firearms. A 2x4? Baseball bat? Golf club? Not a chance they hurt her.

Again, I know: comics. It's just always rubbed me the wrong way.

USER2: What if her muscles are just the strong part and everything else isn't? Luke cages invulnerability works that way. His skin is the only strong part.

THOMPSON: Yeah, same thing. Again, imagine how much force you would require to shove someone through a brick wall, and realize Luke Cage does that EASILY. The bone and muscle density, the density and strength of his tendons and ligaments, these would all have to be like steel cables. I know that he "just" has bulletproof skin, but that doesn't really work for the same reasons. Shoot a bullet at a brick wall. What is it that stops it? It's not the outer layer. It's the solidity, thickness, and density of the material.

Consider how there is normal force acting on you right now. If you're standing it's coming from the floor, and if you're sitting it's coming from the ground and your seated surface, and so on. That's because gravity is acting to pull you down, and the sum of all the forces acting against gravity are what keep you from falling through the floor. The forces involved with throwing a car or shoving someone through a brick wall are going to be pushing against the other direction as they throw or shove. It's an INCREDIBLE amount of force, and that's just at the Jessica Jones / Luke Cage level. With how our non-comic understanding of physics works, Carol Danvers would have to weigh 200,000 lbs or more.

Again, yes, yes, yes I know. Comics. I'm a huge fan. It's just meaningful to know that isn't how force works in our world.

## EXAMPLE 8

CONTEXT: Discussion lauding large/fat women in Ruben's work:

THOMPSON: With respect, this is a disingenuous take. It pops up every few months on some site, but it disregards the multitude of contemporary works that don't support the account's thesis. The author has nothing to say about the goddesses and graces in La Primavera (1470s/80s) or the Birth of Venus (1480s). It's not like Botticelli is a hidden figure in the world of art history, so the implication is that authors of posts like these are compelled to find points to support their thesis rather than presenting information and drawing a conclusion. After studying a lot of art history, the conclusion I've come to is: a lot of people from a lot of cultures like a lot of different bodies. This isn't to argue against body positivity or reinforce the cult of an unattainable or unrealistic female form. Far from it. I'm only chiding against the construction of a beauty paradigm with supporting evidence that isn't actually true or honest.

EDIT: I was being too cautious with my tone. Was at the Met yesterday. My relative education has nothing to do with my conclusion. Just go to a museum with a decent-sized collection. There is NO period that is defined by a predominance of zaftig female subjects. There is strong (strong) variation, of course-- again, any notion of a unifying ideal of female form is delusional-- but your own eyes will refute the case this IG post is making if you walk through a decent museum.

## EXAMPLE 9

CONTEXT: Discussion about whether "the grind is worth it" in the subreddit AskMenOver30

USER1: Yes, it’s worth it. But you probably won’t notice it in your 30’s but in your 50s and 60s you will.

USER2: That’s if he makes it. My aunt worked super hard as a principle and then retired at 53. Died a year later. It’s the exact reason why I lived it up in my 20s. I wouldn’t advise going crazy but everything is easier to do when you’re younger too. Don’t take tomorrow for granted.

THOMPSON: This. My MIL and FIL were going to travel together when they retired. They owned restaurants, so they worked and worked and worked on their feet. Immigrants, so when I say they worked, I mean they fucking WORKED. They had alternating shifts for years, slept in separate beds, sometimes just ships passing in the night. But they were going to travel together when they'd done their work. Brain cancer said otherwise. She was 53. Absolutely shattered my wife.

My FIL sits in his chair upstairs all day and watches TV and misses his best friend.

Tomorrow isn't a promise.

## EXAMPLE 10:

CONTEXT: Conversation topic in "truegaming" was 'is the entire multiplayer gaming environment aggressively mean to each other? Why?'

USER1: Unfortunately, I think you have to find a specific group to play with if you want to reduce toxicity. There's just not enough incentives or punishments online for being a dick. There aren't in IRL situations either, but event organizers and general social pressure can sometimes help. Even close groups of friends can get salty and toxic in some cases.

Being able to stay cool and separate your ego from your game performance is just one of those life skills people have to do the hard work to learn. Not sure if it's realistic to expect any sufficiently large sample of people (as in the case of a multiplayer game's audience) to have done that internal work. And even if by some miracle 90% have, that 10% can still cause misery.

THOMPSON:

    There aren't in IRL situations either, but event organizers and general social pressure can sometimes help. Even close groups of friends can get salty and toxic in some cases.

This doesn't match my experience at all. There's a WORLD of difference between the way my friends and I mess with each other and rip each other up and the way people speak to one another in online games.

Context and intent matter a ton. For one thing, among friends and especially among males, it's typical to build rapport by breaking rapport. It would be really weird if you had a group of friends who were always sincere and earnest and supportive of one another. Sarcasm and ball-busting can be a sign of closeness.

But it has to be earned, and that's where things get weird and uncomfortable. If someone busts your balls a lot, and they haven't earned it through history and a decent track record of rapport-building without ball-busting, it starts to feel like what it is: like they're being a jerk.

And jerks will reflexively hide behind standard ball-busting in order to hide the fact that they're actually jerks. There is a strong correlation between the frequency with which someone has to assert they're "only kidding," and the likelihood they are, at the character level, a jerk.

As someone who plays a ton of competitive games. I think it's It's the worst part about our gaming culture. And it's impossible to call someone out, too, because the assumption that it's just playful banter is such convenient cloaking for jerks.Calls for civility are pounced on to preserve the casual cruelty.

I often have to take weeks or months long breaks from League and other competitive games when work gets intense. Even when deadlines get close and clients get impatient, no one would dare speak to each other the way people communicate in League of Legends. It's worth noting that I work in white collar positions (special effects graphics/ web development), so maybe people who work in mechanics' shops or fast food joints or Amazon warehouses or whatever may have different experiences with professional disrespect. But I simply never, ever, ever see it.

People say, "Oh, well, people are like that in real sports." No, they're f\*cking not. I played sports all through high school, and no one spoke the way people communicate in League of Legends. They were crass and priggish, but the venom and acidity, all spat with the sense of being free of consequences, was just not there. And it wasn't the default. If someone was a prick on another team, they were JERKS. I met plenty of people on other teams who were awesome and respectful, and that was the norm.

The only thing resembling League chat in my real life experience was Marine Corps drill instructors, and even that was enormously tempered by context. Obviously. That's where I'd slot gaming banter: the level of people who were paid to anneal my emotional barriers so I could theoretically handle a combat environment. Awesome stuff, gamers. Keep it up!

The truth is that there are MASSIVE social consequences to be as reflexively rude, condescending, mean-spirited, and dismissive as people are in online games.

## EXAMPLE 11

CONTEXT: Discussing the January 6, 2021 insurrection and the role that online social media platforms played in fomenting it.

THOMPSON: I left Facebook in 2018, shortly after the revelations came that they were allowing third parties (Microsoft, etc.) to access personal messages. I had already drafted the "I'm leaving Facebook" message a few times after learning about the Rohingya massacres in Myanmar.

It was really hard.

I've missed umpteen birthdays. I have no idea how many events. I found out weeks or months after the fact about engagements, pregnancies, and births. I knowingly ended a multitude of hoary friendships that were only sustained by outbursts on the platform, positive and negative alike. People from schools, people I served with, old workmates, etc. It's not that I can't reach out. It's that I'm not mystically aware of their goings on, and they don't occur to me unless circumstances dredge up their memories-- the way it was before Facebook and MySpace.

I've had to turn down work on several occasions because I won't touch their ecosystem. None of their domains are allowed to touch my internal traffic; I block them at the router.

Whatsapp is simply better software than Signal.

(EDIT-- This was unclear, but I thought it was implied: I don't use Whatsapp anymore, despite it being better software than Signal. Not only do I not use (and, in fact, deleted my account for) Whatsapp, but I think Instagram and Whatsapp are in some ways worse because they surreptitiously use the Facebook messaging backend while making you believe you're clear of the company's spying, tracking, advertising infrastructure, and the co-morbid depredations that accompany all of those. I stepped away from Whatsapp and Instagram, not shutting down my accounts but deleting them, the same day I stepped away from FB: December 25, 2018. The last holdout was Oculus, which I could justify from it being a separate account. Then Facebook revealed the cost of preserving my existing library was to integrate more fully into their ecosystem. As I say below, I noped out. I will and do use worse software because I refuse to use ANY Facebook stuff.)

People whom I love and who love me have reached out saying, "I miss your perspective. Can you at least use Instagram?" I loved Instagram!

I had $2000 or more of Oculus games. For a while I forgave myself because I only had an Oculus account, which I'd never paired with Facebook. Stupid, I know, but I love VR. Vehemently. Then they decided the price of a Quest 2 included a Facebook account. I deleted my Oculus account after that announcement.

I'm lucky enough that my church group came with me to a Slack channel. Mostly. I still learned about a couple pregnancies, like, a day late. We use Eventbrite. Birthdays are still manual. But it sucks not to have it all in one integrated platform. I'm also a gamer. My Discord servers are vital. But I would be lying if I said it didn't still feel like a sacrifice.

But Facebook is evil.

They actively persist in making the world a worse place. They don't have to. They could be better. Zuckerberg could be better. But they aren't. He isn't.

You might not believe in evil. Maybe it's not a thing. Moral relativism, shades of grey, etc. I can dig that.

But if there's evil in the world, Facebook absolutely qualifies. And they make great stuff. No one would sin if it wasn't fun, useful, rewarding, gratifying, or convenient.

I guess I'm grateful my hobby doesn't attach me to the platform.

## EXAMPLE 12

CONTEXT: Initial post was a jpg for Spider-Man 3 and the title "I might be the strangest human on the planet but this is in my top 10 of my facorite marvel movies"

THOMPSON: You're not strange.

You have bad taste in movies.

Your recommendations carry the same weight as if I received restaurant recommendations from a cat after I watched it lick its own ass.

Fortunately, lots of people have bad taste, so you're not as strange as you think.

Spider-Man 3 is as close to an objective cinematic disaster as can be achieved with $100m+ budget. It's up there with Rise of the Skywalker in terms of plot contrivance, absurdity, laziness of direction and script, and ignoring its own mythology.

It speaks to poor or undeveloped standards on your end that you find so much to love in Spider-Man 3. But, again, look at the world around you, and you will see a huge community of people who hold themselves and their world to no standard whatsoever. Once more, you're not strange and have great company in your low standards.

Nothing in art is objective; even failures or craft or happenstance of production can be delightful to people. But Spider-Man 3 is very nearly close to something that can be an objective standard for absolute garbage when it comes to the art of cinema. This is the cinematic opinion take of saying Hitler had some good ideas and Pol Pot maybe didn't go far enough.

## EXAMPLE 13

Context: Original Post was "18 and feeling behind. Others my age know 10 languages, I’m still on Week 4 of CS50. What should I do?"

THOMPSON:

Don't think about anyone else. Meet your own milestones.

For real applications, learn to make CRUD apps with your preferred tooling and with as little AI help as possible.

So databases, views, deployment, routing, etc. For CompSci itself, you're on the right track with CS50, and in general data structures/algorithms (as a broad concept) will take you really far.

If you use AI help, make sure you explain to it very clearly that it should never finish your code or write your code but to help you understand concepts.

The trick is that when you know one language well enough to make an app, you now have a really solid underpinning for every other language (since they're all different takes on solving similar problems). It's not 1:1 by any stretch, but certainly someone who's extremely competent with one of the first-step languages (Python, JS, Ruby) will have a much easier time exploring others.

I started learning Unreal Engine last year. I have a deep background in JavaScript, Python, and Ruby with many of their most popular frameworks. I won't say that C++ in Unreal Engine (DISTINCT FROM PURE C++!) was EASY for me to learn, but since I already knew how to "speak computer," it was a billion times easier than learning Ruby, i.e. my first programming language.

Learn the core principles like functions, data structures, data types, and control flow.

Practice them by building CRUD apps.

Fortify your knowledge with data structures and algorithms.

Notice that nowhere in the above did I say look at what your friends are doing or claiming. You are the only you in this life.

Above all if AI ever solves a problem for you or writes your code for you, you aren't learning. You MUST struggle and you MUST persevere and you MUST fail to really get this stuff when it doesn't come naturally.
