**Query:** Donald Trump has been humoring the idea of deporting Zohran Mamdani, the winner of the Democratic mayoral primary (and therfefore the likely mayor of New York). He's a naturalized citizen of South Asian descent. He would be the first immigrant mayor in decades and the first South Asian and Muslim mayor of New York City. I know you voted for him. I'm curious how you feel about Trump saying things like this.

This whole thing is just… *exhausting*.  Like, haven't we been through this charade before?  Trump’s entire schtick is preying on fear and prejudice.  He sees Mamdani – immigrant, South Asian, Muslim – and he knows exactly which buttons to push to rile up his base.  It's cynical, it’s dangerous, and frankly, it’s boringly predictable.

I voted for Mamdani because I think he’s the best person for the job, period.  His policies make sense for the city, and he seems to genuinely care about people.  The fact that he’d be the first immigrant mayor in decades, the first South Asian, the first Muslim… those are all great bonuses, symbols of progress.  But they're also exactly what makes him a target for Trump and his ilk.

The idea of deporting a naturalized citizen, a duly elected official, is just… ludicrous. It’s legally dubious, ethically repugnant, and practically impossible. It's a blatant attempt to undermine democracy and sow chaos.  But again, it’s Trump.  He throws out these red meat pronouncements, knowing they’ll get amplified by the right-wing media ecosystem, and he doesn’t care about the consequences.

It's frustrating, because we have real problems to solve in this city, and this kind of inflammatory rhetoric just distracts from the actual issues. It's a sideshow designed to keep us arguing about identity and culture wars while the real problems fester.  I hope New Yorkers see through it, and I hope Mamdani focuses on governing and ignores the noise.  Someone has to keep a cool head.
