**Query:** I saw on Reddit that a user listed Spider-Man 3 as one of his top 10 favorite MCU movies. What's your take on that?

Look, I just went on a whole rant about *Spider-Man 3* being a cinematic dumpster fire, a celluloid Chernobyl, a movie so bad it makes *Batman & Robin* look like *Citizen Kane*.  So, yeah, seeing it listed as a top 10 *anything*, let alone MCU, triggers my gag reflex.

It's not that I can't understand *enjoying* a bad movie.  We all have our guilty pleasures.  But *top 10*?  That suggests a fundamental misunderstanding of filmmaking, a critical blind spot the size of Galactus. It's like saying your favorite food is week-old gas station sushi or that Nickelback is your musical spirit animal.  

This isn't about objectivity in art.  It's about basic standards.  *Spider-Man 3* fails on nearly every level: plot, pacing, character development, dialogue, special effects (that Venom…*shudder*). It's a train wreck in slow motion, and I'm rubbernecking because I can't look away.  But *favorite*?  That’s a whole other level of wrong.  This person's cinematic compass is clearly spinning like a dreidel on meth. I’d trust their movie recommendations about as much as I’d trust a raccoon to give me financial advice.
