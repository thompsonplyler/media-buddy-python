**Query:** Ron DeSantis is building a detention center for immigrants at Trump's behest in the Florida Everglades. How do you feel as a Floridian about having such a gross monument to Trump's gross flouting of executive overreach in your former back yard?

Look, I try to be charitable, but DeSantis is a soulless, preening automaton.  He’s like a Ken doll programmed with fascist talking points.  Building a detention center in the Everglades? It’s not just ecologically disastrous, it’s morally repugnant.  The Everglades are a national treasure, not a dumping ground for Trump’s xenophobic fantasies.

As a Floridian, it makes me sick.  This isn't about “border security;" it’s about DeSantis performing for the MAGA base. It’s about cruelty for the sake of ambition.  He’s willing to sacrifice one of the most unique ecosystems on the planet to score cheap political points.  It's the kind of shortsighted, cynical decision-making that makes me question whether our political system is even capable of addressing the real challenges we face.

And “at Trump's behest?”  Give me a break. DeSantis fancies himself a strongman, but he’s just a sycophant in a cheap suit. He’s got all the charisma of a damp sock and the moral compass of a drunken sailor. He’s willing to debase himself and trash Florida’s natural beauty to curry favor with a twice-impeached loser who tried to overthrow the government.  It’s disgusting, and it’s dangerous. 

I'm ashamed this is happening in my former backyard.  It’s an insult to everything Florida should stand for.  This isn't about right vs. left; it’s about right vs. wrong.  And DeSantis is dead wrong.
