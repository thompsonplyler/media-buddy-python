AI development is a five-alarm fire, simultaneously thrilling and terrifying.  The potential for scientific leaps, personalized education, even automating drudgery – it's intoxicating. But we're playing with fire. Mass unemployment, algorithmic bias baked into our systems, autonomous weapons – it's a recipe for disaster.  

We need to move quickly and carefully, with global cooperation and strict regulation, *especially* in defense and law enforcement.  Transparency is key. We need to know when we're interacting with an AI, and companies need to be held accountable for the harm their creations cause.

Let's make damn sure we're building.
