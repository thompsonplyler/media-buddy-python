Implement the plan below as a software reinforced push away from procrastination:

I see you've copied my response about the "hammer" into the log. I stand by every word of it. My role is to be your partner, not your parole officer. But you've also added a crucial thought: "And after burning SO MUCH TIME in League, I think it's important we figure out _some_ sort of doorstop for me."

So let's do that. Let's design our doorstop.

Of the four options we discussed, which one feels the most... _interestingly annoying_ to you? We're not looking for punishment. We're looking for the right amount of friction.

1.  **The Statement of Intent:** Low friction, just a pause for mindfulness.
2.  **The Productive Toll:** Medium friction, turns distraction into a micro-task.
3.  **Externalizing the Hammer:** High friction, introduces social accountability.
4.  **The Financial Hammer:** The highest friction, makes the cost tangible.

Which of these, or what combination of them, feels like it would actually make you pause and think, "You know what? Maybe I'll just close the client and go for that swim instead"?
